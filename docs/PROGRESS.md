# Progress

Status: IN PROGRESS

Tick each step when its acceptance criteria in docs/SPEC.md §12 pass and it is committed.

## Workflow
- **Feature** = one step below → git branch `feature/N-<slug>` + OpenSpec change `N-<slug>`.
- **Task** = one `- [ ]` item in the change's `tasks.md` → one git commit (`feat(N-<slug>): <summary>`).
- Plan a feature with `openspec-propose`, implement tasks with `openspec-apply-change`, finish with `openspec-archive-change`, then merge the branch into `main`.
- **Current feature/branch:** feature 2 active on `feature/2-shared-types-stream-parser` (OpenSpec change `2-shared-types-stream-parser`, 3/6 tasks done).

- [x] 1. Scaffold
- [ ] 2. Shared types + stream parser
- [ ] 3. Provider adapters
- [ ] 4. Agent loop, tools, security layer
- [ ] 5. Design foundation (Impeccable)
- [ ] 6. Chat UI, approvals, terminal log
- [ ] 7. Artifact renderers + Mermaid
- [ ] 8. Versions, diff, revert, undo, settings, persistence
- [ ] 9. Final design pass (Impeccable)
- [ ] 10. Docs

## Blocked
<!-- One entry per blocker: what is blocked, why, and the exact command or action a human must take. -->
_None yet._

## Next
<!-- If a step is only partly done, write exactly what remains here for the next iteration. -->
_Continue feature 2 on `feature/2-shared-types-stream-parser`: run `openspec-apply-change` for `2-shared-types-stream-parser` and implement task 2.2 (artifact parsing in the state machine: `artifact_open`/`artifact_delta`/`artifact_close` with split-tag reassembly, raw content, unknown-type preservation, kebab-case identifier generation, and `artifact_close {incomplete: true}` on `end()`), then continue with tasks 2.3–3.1._

## Log
<!-- One line per completed step: date, step, short summary. -->
- 2026-09-27, step 1 (Scaffold): pnpm monorepo with strict TS, ESLint/Prettier, Vitest, Playwright+axe e2e, Hono server + Vite web, `design:check` wired into `check`, and GitHub Actions CI. `pnpm dev` starts both apps; `pnpm check` is green end-to-end.
